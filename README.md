# TriviaGame

### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

* This is a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* After the player selects an answer (or time runs out), a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option or consoling them for choosing the wrong one will display. After a few seconds, the game moves forward without user input.

* On the final screen, the applicaiton shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

* This was built using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and jQuery
